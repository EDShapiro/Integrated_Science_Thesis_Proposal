\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Magnetically Confined Fusion}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Studying Plasma Fusion}
The motivation for this project is tied in to the overall goals of the Partnership Center for High-Fidelity Boundary Plasma Simulation, which aims to understand the boundary physics of a plasma in the ITER Tokama reactor using high fidelity simulations.
As such, a bird's eye view of the current research being performed in the field of plasma physics will be presented. \cite{J_Friedberg:1}
This will be followed by a an overview of the diffusion model that will be explored in this paper.\\
